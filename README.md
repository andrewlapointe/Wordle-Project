# Wordle-Project

## Personal web application practice.

This was a project designed to learn the basics of JavaScript as well as practice HTML and CSS. As my first foray into JS it is rather basic, but I feel that it was a good learning tool.

## Concepts Learned

- accessing HTML elements
- modifying CSS styles and classes
- creating JS functions
- basic web application design
