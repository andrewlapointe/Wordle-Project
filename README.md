# Wordle-Project

## Personal web application practice.

## Concepts Learned

- accessing HTML elements
- modifying CSS styles and classes
- creating JS functions
- basic web application design

# Overview

This project served both as a way to learn JavaScript and as an exploration in web development as a whole. I am still new as a programmer and am unsure of what I would like to specialize in. I have taken a simple HTML/CSS class which I enjoyed and I wanted to delve a little deeper into the front end side of computer science.

This web application is a recreation of the popular online game [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) by the New York times. The object of the game is to guess a five letter word in six guesses or less. After each guess the game will prompt the player with hints.

A green square means that the letter is in the right place. Yellow indicates that the letter is in the word, but in the wrong place. If a square is red, the letter isn't anywhere in the word.

### Concepts Learned

- accessing HTML elements
- modifying CSS styles and classes
- creating JS functions
- basic web application design
  {Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running (starting the server and navigating through the web pages) and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Web Pages

The first page is the main game page. It has a navigation bar with links to the other pages and the actual game of wordle. Wordle is made of a grid of boxes along with an on screen keyboard. The keyboard is used to fill the empty boxes with your guess.

The second page is the about me page. It also has the navigation bar, but other than that it is just a page of text used to inform visitors about the purpose of the website.

# Development Environment

The IDE used to develope this project was Visual Studio Code. The "Live Server" and "Prettier" Extensions were used.

The application was built in HTML CSS and JavaScript.
