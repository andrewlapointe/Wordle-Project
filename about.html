          <p>This project served both as a way to learn JavaScript and as an exploration in web development as a whole. 
              I am still new as a programmer and am unsure of what I would like to specialize in. I have taken a simple 
              HTML/CSS class which I enjoyed and I wanted to delve a little deeper into the front end side of computer science.

              This web application is a recreation of the popular online game <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html">Wordle</a> 
              by the New York times. The object of the game is to guess a five letter word in six guesses or less. After each guess the 
              game will prompt the player with hints.</p>
